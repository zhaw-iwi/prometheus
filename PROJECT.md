# PROJECT.md

## Short project summary
PROMETHEUS is an event-driven Java framework for explicit state-machine agent control with first-class regulation and multimodal behaviour plans.

## Milestones checklist
- [x] Milestone 1: Output-profile-aware prompt and generation flow for realtime compatibility
- [x] Milestone 2: Realtime multimodal seed agent and complement replay coverage

## Milestone 1
### Date
2026-02-24

### Goal
Add modality/output-profile-aware policy execution so realtime clients can receive speech-only prompt contracts while backend generation can produce complementary non-speech behaviour.

### What changed
- Added `OutputProfile` (`FULL_PLAN`, `REALTIME_SPEECH`, `BACKEND_COMPLEMENT`).
- Threaded output profile through runtime and state/policy prompt bundle generation.
- Extended `PromptPolicy` with profile-specific output contracts and generation behavior:
  - `FULL_PLAN`: existing speech + optional nonverbal gesture.
  - `REALTIME_SPEECH`: speech only.
  - `BACKEND_COMPLEMENT`: nonverbal-only complement derived from latest assistant speech in history.
- Updated endpoints:
  - `GET /{agentID}/prompt?profile=...`
  - `POST /{agentID}/behaviour/generate` accepts `outputProfile`.
- Added validation for unknown profile values (`400 Bad Request`).

### How to run
1. Configure properties as in `README.md`.
2. Start app:
   - PowerShell: `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`

### How to test
- Targeted tests run:
  - `.\mvnw.cmd "-Dtest=PromptPolicyUnitTest,PromptPolicyGestureUnitTest,AgentApplicationServicePromptUnitTest,AgentApplicationServiceGenerateOptionsUnitTest,AgentClientCompatibilityWebMvcTest" test`

### Known issues and decisions
- `BACKEND_COMPLEMENT` currently derives nonverbal output from latest assistant speech and does not yet generate `motion`/`display` channels.
- `BACKEND_COMPLEMENT` emits no behaviour event when no prior assistant speech exists (intentional: avoid synthetic `NONE` events).
- Existing API behavior remains default-compatible via `FULL_PLAN` when no profile is provided.

### Next steps
1. Add explicit assistant speech event type for cleaner realtime acknowledge semantics.
2. Extend complement generation to support `motion` and `display`.
3. Add integration test covering realtime speech + backend complement end-to-end.

## Milestone 2
### Date
2026-02-24

### Goal
Add a concrete agent template and deterministic integration replay that demonstrate realtime speech interaction combined with backend nonverbal complement behaviour under multimodal input.

### What changed
- Added manual seed agent template:
  - `src/test/java/ch/zhaw/prometheus/agents/RealtimeMultimodalAgent.java`
- Added deterministic scripted gateway fixture:
  - `src/main/resources/scripts/realtime-speech-backend-complement-replay-script.json`
- Added integration replay test that validates:
  - realtime prompt fetched with `profile=REALTIME_SPEECH` includes speech-only contract
  - prompt context includes both verbal and facial-emotion observations
  - assistant realtime speech acknowledged via `/acknowledge`
  - backend complement generation via `outputProfile=BACKEND_COMPLEMENT` emits nonverbal-only behaviour
  - `src/test/java/ch/zhaw/prometheus/integration/RealtimeSpeechBackendComplementReplayIntegrationTest.java`
- Updated README seed-agent template list to include `RealtimeMultimodalAgent`.

### How to run
1. Configure properties as in `README.md`.
2. Start app:
   - PowerShell: `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`

### How to test
- Replay-focused tests run:
  - `.\mvnw.cmd "-Dtest=RealtimeSpeechBackendComplementReplayIntegrationTest,MultimodalScriptReplayIntegrationTest" test`

### Known issues and decisions
- Realtime assistant acknowledgements currently reuse `resp.behaviour_plan` payload conventions for compatibility.
- Complement flow remains nonverbal-only in this milestone.

### Next steps
1. Introduce explicit assistant speech event type for realtime acknowledgements.
2. Expand complement generation coverage for `motion`/`display`.
3. Add scripted assertions for mixed-profile behaviour generation in longer conversations.
