# Generic multimodal refinement results

Plan: [Generic multimodal refinement](PLAN_GENERIC_REFINEMENT.md).

## Milestone 208

Completed. Production guidance uses neutral schema descriptions and no preset
demonstration task. Existing user agreements/history are unchanged; saved prompt
upgrades are deferred to the tested migration in milestone 213.

Passed 15 focused Java tests (14 task unit tests and the scoped MySQL/Live reload
integration test). Runner: `target/gptlive-acceptance-b5b4c553d9/java.log`, exit 0;
disposable schema/account removed. No live provider interpretation claim follows
from the mocked fixtures.
